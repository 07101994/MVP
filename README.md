# MVP

There has always been the need for Microsoft MVPs to manage their community activities in an easier way. The online portal works fine, but having a similar thing in your pocket to create activities on the fly is what we need. Which is what this project is for!

The MVP API is open so there definitely are possibilities here. With a community of Xamarin MVPs it shouldn't be too hard to come up with something fancy, right? If you want to pitch in, take a look at the issues currently filed, which should contain some of the basic functionalities the app should be able to perform. Does one of them appeal to you? Go ahead and pick it up and submit a PR!
