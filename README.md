# MVP

There has always been the need for Microsoft MVPs to manage their community activities in an easier way. The online portal works fine, but having a similar thing in your pocket to create activities on the fly is what we really need. Which is what this project is for!

The idea here is that with a great community full of Xamarin / Microsoft MVPs it shouldn't be too hard to come up with something fancy, right? Since it would have to happen in a somewhat streamlined fashion though it would be nice to focus the work in a single GitHub repo, which is what you see here.

How do I contribute?

If you want to pitch in, take a look at the issues currently filed, which should contain some of the basic functionalities the app should be able to perform. Does one of them appeal to you? Go ahead and pick it up, let me know and submit a PR when you're done!

So, where do I get started?
